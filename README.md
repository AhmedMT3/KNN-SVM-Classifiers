# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with KNN & SVM 🌸

This project demonstrates **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classifying iris flowers 🌺 into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. A great way to dive into the basics of classification and explore algorithm comparison!

## 📋 Project Goals

- 🛠 **Implement** the KNN and SVM models on a classic dataset
- 📊 **Compare Performance** of the models with cross-validation
- 📈 **Evaluate Metrics** including accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score to find the best-performing model

## 📚 Dataset

We’re using the well-known [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) 🌿, containing measurements of different iris species:
- **Features**: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width
- **Classes**: Three species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica (50 samples each)

With this dataset, we’ll predict species based on a flower’s sepal and petal measurements.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To get started, you’ll need:
- **Python** 3.6+ and **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scikit-learn`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload** `iris.csv` (available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)) when prompted 📂.
2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - If using **Google Colab**, upload the file when prompted in the notebook.
   - If running locally, ensure `iris.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.

## 🏆 Results

The notebook provides a comprehensive **comparison of KNN vs. SVM** based on evaluation metrics. By the end, you’ll understand which model performs best and why, with a detailed breakdown of each model’s strengths on the Iris dataset! 🌟
